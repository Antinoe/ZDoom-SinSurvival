-Development Roadmap-

Note to self: Don't work on so many things at once. You'll just stress yourself out. Take it slow and focus on one thing at a time.

Here's a list of features to implement in chronological order:
1.) Injury System
	-Maybe a Medical Fabricator item that can be combined with materials?
	-(Fiber Plant + Deconstructor = Organic Fiber)
	-(Organic Fiber + Medical Fabricator = Bandages)
	-(Organic Fiber + Aluminum = Aluminum Fiber Mixture)
	-(Aluminum Fiber Mixture + Medical Fabricator = Sutures)
2.) Needs System
3.) Provision Class
4.) Resources to gather.
