# Sin Survival

Sin Survival is a Dwelling Sin addon that aims to provide a survival framework for mods/mapsets to use in Doom. If configured, you will receive injuries that require specific treatment. Nutrients and Minerals will be important, not only to sustain your body, but also to strengthen it. There will be resources for you to gather, which will be used to craft equipment and provisions. Please keep in mind that this is in its Alpha stage, so there isn't much for now. Its current feature(s) can be found below.

### Features
- Barotrauma-inspired Injury System
	- Whenever you're hurt, an injury pertaining to the Damage Type will be applied to you.
	- Rather than universal healing items, Sin Survival features medical items to treat these injuries:
		- Bandages stop bleeding.
		- Burn Salves provide relief for burns.
		- Sutures stitch up Lacerations, Gunshot Wounds and Deep Tissue Injuries.
		- Tweezers remove Foreign Bodies. (Bullets, Shrapnel, etc.)
