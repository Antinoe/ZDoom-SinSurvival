# Sin Survival

Sin Survival is a Dwelling Sin addon that aims to provide a resource framework for mods/mapsets to use in Doom. There isn't much for now, but this will eventually contain enough content to build survival games with. Its current feature(s) can be found below.

### Features
- Barotrauma-inspired Injury System
	- Whenever you're hurt, an injury pertaining to the Damage Type will be applied to you.
	- Rather than universal healing items, Sin Survival features medical supplies to treat these injuries:
		- Bandages stop Bleeding.
		- Burn Salves provide relief for Burns.
		- Sutures stitch up Lacerations, Gunshot Wounds and Deep Tissue Injuries.
		- Tweezers remove Foreign Bodies. (Bullets, Shrapnel, etc.)
		- Gel Ice Packs provide relief for Blunt Force Trauma.
	- Wearing Armor stops most lethal injuries. What would be a Gunshot Wound turns into Blunt Force Trauma, for instance.
	- And remember: Time heals all wounds.
