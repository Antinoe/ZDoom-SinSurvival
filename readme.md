# Sin Survival

Sin Survival is a Dwelling Sin addon that aims to provide a resource framework for mods/mapsets to use in Doom. There isn't much for now, but this will eventually contain enough content to build survival games with. Its current feature(s) can be found below.

### Features
- Barotrauma-inspired Injury System:
	- Whenever you're hurt, an injury pertaining to the Damage Type will be applied to you.
	- Sin Survival replaces Dwelling Sin's medical items with nigh-identical variants that heal these afflictions, but developers are encouraged to create their own as well.
	- Wearing Armor stops most lethal injuries. What would be a Gunshot Wound turns into Blunt Trauma, for instance.
### Development Roadmap
- Injury System [__PARTIALLY DONE__]
- Needs System (Hunger, Thirst, Sleep, etc.) [__NOT THERE YET__]
- Provision Class (Developers will be able to create Food and Beverage items.) [__NOT THERE YET__]
