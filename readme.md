
## ⚠️ **NOTICE: Sin Survival is now part of Continuum**
This project has been merged into **Continuum** to streamline development and improve accessibility. You can find the updated version here: [Continuum on GitHub](https://github.com/Antinoe/ZDoom-Continuum).

# **Sin Survival – Final Update**

**Sin Survival** was an addon for *Dwelling Sin*, designed as a resource framework for creating survival-based mechanics in Doom. To simplify dependencies and improve integration, its features have now been fully absorbed into *Continuum*.

## **Key Features (Now in Continuum)**

- **Barotrauma-Inspired Injury/Affliction System**
  - Injuries apply based on Damage Type (e.g., gunshot wounds, burns, fractures).  
  - Treatment requires appropriate medical items, though universal healing options remain possible.
  - Armor mitigates injuries—e.g., a gunshot wound might be reduced to blunt trauma.

- **Item & Equipment Systems**
  - **Attire Class** – Wearable gear.
  - **Ballistic Armor Class** – Realistic armor penetration mechanics for different calibers.
  - **Barrier Class** – *Halo/Metroid*-style shielding that absorbs damage before armor.

- **Survival Mechanics**
  - **Medicine Class** – Healing items that interact with the affliction system.
  - **Needs System** – Hunger, thirst, and other survival elements.
  - **Provision Class** – Food, beverages, and other consumables.

- **Combat & RPG Mechanics**
  - **Melee Class** – Hitscan-based melee weapon framework.
  - **Stats System** – *Soulsborne*-inspired attributes like Vigor (HP) and Endurance (SP).
